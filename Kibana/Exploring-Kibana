### Instructions

1. Add the sample web log data to Kibana.

2. Answer the following questions:

    - In the last 7 days, how many unique visitors were located in India?
      - 228 Unique Visitors
    - In the last 24 hours, of the visitors from China, how many were using Mac OSX?
      - 11 Unique Visitors
    - In the last 2 days, what percentage of visitors received 404 errors? How about 503 errors?
      - 404: 0%
      - 503: 2.381%
    - In the last 7 days, what country produced the majority of the traffic on the website?
      - China (20.5%)
    - Of the traffic that's coming from that country, what time of day had the highest amount of activity?
      - 10 a.m.
    - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).
      - css - a programming language which is used tor writing webpage elements
      - deb - a linux software package, used by ubuntu
      - gz - a compressed archive using gzip
      - rpm - linux software package developed for Red Hat operating system
      - zip - compressed archive like the gz

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
     - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
       - Average bytes = 10,735.667B
       - Unique visitors = 3
     - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
       - For the amount of bytes there were at that time, there was a very low amount of visitors compares to the other hours.

4. Filter the data by this event.
     - What is the timestamp for this event?
       - 2022-01-16 21:57:28.582
     - What kind of file was downloaded?
       - RPM
     - From what country did this activity originate?
       - India
     - What HTTP response codes were encountered by this visitor?
       - 200

     - What is the source IP address of this activity?
       - 35.143.166.159
     - What are the geo coordinates of this activity?
       - lat: 43.34121
       - lon: --73.6103075
     - What OS was the source machine running?
       - windows 8
     - What is the full URL that was accessed?
       -  https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-6.3.2-i686.rpm
     - From what website did the visitor's traffic originate?
       - http://facebook.com/success/jay-c-buckey
     
6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights. 

     - What do you think the user was doing?
       - Downloading linux software package developed for Red Hat operating system.
     - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
       - Most likely not; this was used to download a metricbeat package
     - Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?
       - No because the download required a high amount of bytes.
     - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidelines?
       - The referer was from http://facebook.com/success/jay-c-buckey
       - Facebook might be outside of compliance guidelines
